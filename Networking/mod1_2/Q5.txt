What Happens When Duplicate IPs Are Configured in a Network?

When two devices on the same network have the same IP address, it creates a conflict, leading to connectivity issues. Here’s what happens:
1. Network Instability
    The devices with duplicate IPs compete for network communication.
    One device may work while the other disconnects or gets intermittent access.

2. ARP Conflicts 
    Devices use ARP to find the MAC address for an IP.
    If two devices respond with different MAC addresses for the same IP, the ARP table gets confused, causing misdirected traffic.

3. Connection Drops & Errors
    You might see errors like "IP address conflict detected" on Windows, Linux, or macOS.
    Some devices might automatically disable their network connection to avoid conflicts.

4. Issues in Servers & Critical Systems
    If a server has a duplicate IP, clients trying to connect may get wrong responses or fail to access the service.
    Load balancers, databases, and file servers may face major service disruptions.

How to Fix It?
    Use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) – It assigns unique IPs automatically.
    Check ARP Table – Run arp -a to check conflicting IPs.
    Manually Reconfigure IPs – Change one device’s IP to avoid duplication.
    Use IP Reservation – Configure the router to assign fixed IPs to important devices.
