How to Connect to a Remote Machine via SSH and Telnet Using a Terminal

SSH is a secure way to remotely access a machine over an encrypted connection.
Method 1: SSH (Secure Shell) 

Step 1: Install SSH 
On the remote machine, install the OpenSSH Server:
sudo apt install -y openssh-server

Start and enable the SSH service:

sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh

Check if the SSH service is running:
systemctl status ssh

Step 2: Find the Remote Machine's IP Address
On the remote machine, run:
ip a

Example output:
inet 192.168.1.100/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global eth0
The IP address is 192.168.1.100.

Step 3: Connect to the Remote Machine via SSH
On your local machine, run:
ssh <username>@<remote_ip>

Example:
ssh user@192.168.1.100
If connecting for the first time, type "yes" to accept the connection.
Once connected, you will have terminal access to the remote machine.


Method 2: Telnet 
Telnet is an older protocol for remote access but lacks encryption, making it insecure.

Step 1: Install Telnet Server (on Remote Machine)

sudo apt install -y telnetd

Start and enable the Telnet service:

sudo systemctl start inetd
sudo systemctl enable inetd

Step 2: Connect to the Remote Machine via Telnet

On your local machine, run:

telnet <remote_ip>

Example:
telnet 192.168.1.100
You will be prompted for a username and password. Enter them to access the remote machine.
