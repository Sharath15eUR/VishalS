Q10 - How a DHCP Server Assigns IP Addresses

1) Device Requests an IP (DHCP Discovery)

    When a device connects to a network, it broadcasts a request for an IP address.
    This request is called a DHCPDISCOVER message.

2) DHCP Server Offers an IP (DHCP Offer)

    The DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER message.
    This message contains an available IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and lease time.

3) Device Accepts the IP (DHCP Request)

    The device replies with a DHCPREQUEST message, confirming it wants the offered IP.

4) DHCP Server Confirms (DHCP Acknowledgment)

    The server sends a DHCPACK (Acknowledgment) message, officially assigning the IP.
    The device can now use this IP to communicate on the network.
